Actually I've made this project for MyLove...😍 on Valentine's Day...❤️<br>
When i was doing this on that time i forgot the difference between machine code and human feelings...😔 <br>Because i cracked her feelings...💔<br>
Her feelings like an executable file which i've cracked and decompile it, during that time i've lost my source code which was she...💔<br>
So, some codes really very pretty...😍 by default, it's not mean you to change the code or crack it or something like that,as i did 😔<br>
I am just sharing my feelings that what was going on mee while doing this and sorry if you feel bored or upset...🙏

## What's the exploit-->🤯
It is a fun project so don't take it seriously. Here i'm using c as a backend part where you will find a lot of love test where you have to decrypt...🤭,if you can't crack them then it can damage your device..😈<br>
That's it what are you waiting for, here is nothing for you buddyy go and try it out...😉

### Infected from
* Shell Scripting
* C

## Let's inject it on your laappyyy..💻
Right now i'll teach you how to inject this malicious code to your laptop...😈

### R3qu1r3m3nts
For run this virus you have to install "espeak sl pv cmatrix gnome-terminal lolcat xcowsay oneko" those packages. if you have already install on your device then ignore it
otherwise, don't worry first you can run it as a root user...
```sh
sudo bash loveria_virus.sh
```
but this will work only debian and arch based linux if you have another based linux like centos,suse,etc...
then you have to install those packages manually...

### 3xplo1t4t10n
If all packages are downloaded after that exploit the code...😉 i mean exit from root terminal and run it as a normal user...
```sh
bash loveria_virus.sh
```
Once, if you run the program then don't terminate it...👿
