Actually I've made this project for MyLove...😍 on Valentine's Day...❤️<br>
When i was doing this on that time i forgot the difference between machine code and human feelings...😔 <br>Because i cracked her feelings...💔<br>
Her feelings like an executable file which i've cracked and decompile it, during that time i've lost my source code which was she...💔<br>
So, some codes are looking very pretty...😍 by default, it's not mean you to change the code or crack it or something like that,as i did 😔<br>
I am just sharing my feelings that what was going on mee while doing this....
